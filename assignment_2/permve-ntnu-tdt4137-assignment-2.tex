\textbf{Assess in \ac{NGOMSL} how effective placing a phone call is by using the ``Favorite'' feature versus dialing a number when using \textit{Apple IOS}.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Give examples of typical ``unit-tasks'' for the telephone app and model the top-level in \ac{NGOMSL}. Remember to include the unit-task level.}

Typical unit-tasks for the telephone app includes:

\begin{itemize}
\item Creating a new contact
\item Editing an existing contact
\item Checking answering machine
\item Calling a number
\item Calling a contact
\item Searching for a contact
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Model the goal ``call'', which calls a person.}

\begin{tcblisting}{

}
Method to accomplish goal of calling a person
Step 1: Recall name of person to call
Step 2: Retrieve-LTM whether person is a favorite contact
Step 3: Decide: If person is a favorite contact Then accomplish the goal of calling favorite contact Else accomplish the goal of calling a person by dialing
Step 4: Return with goal accomplished
\end{tcblisting}

\begin{tcblisting}{

Method to accomplish goal of calling person by dialing
Step 1: Retain Dialer as button to press
Step 2: Accomplish the goal of pressing a button
Step 3: Accomplish the goal of dialing number
Step 4: Retain call button as button to press
Step 5: Accomplish the goal of pressing a button
Step 6: Return with goal accomplished
\end{tcblisting}

\begin{tcblisting}{

Method to accomplish goal of calling favorite contact
Step 1: Retain Favorite as button to press
Step 2: Accomplish the goal of pressing a button
Step 3: Recall name of person to call
Step 4: Retain name of person to call as button to press
Step 5: Accomplish the goal of pressing a button
Step 6: Return with goal accomplished
\end{tcblisting}

\begin{tcblisting}{
    listing only,
    colback = LemonChiffon1
}
Method to accomplish goal of dialing number
Step 1: Recall name of person to call
Step 2: Retrieve-LTM next chunk of person's phone-number
Step 3: Decide: If no more chunks, then return with goal accomplished
Step 4: Decide: If no more digits in chunk, then goto step 2
Step 5: Retain next digit in chunk as button to press
Step 6: Accomplish the goal of pressing a button
Step 7: Goto step 4
\end{tcblisting}

\begin{tcblisting}{
    listing only,
    colback = LemonChiffon1
}
Method to accomplish goal of pressing button
Step 1: Recall button to press
Step 2: Locate button on screen
Step 3: Move finger to button area
Step 4: Press button
Step 5: Return with goal accomplished

\item \textbf{Compute execution time for the two phoning alternatives.}

\textit{CP = 1.2, B=0.1, H=0.4, K=0.2, M=1.2, P=1.1 (in seconds)}

It is assumed that the user remembers an 8-digit phone number as chunks of 2 digits each. For both scenarios it is also assumed that the user starts from the ``last used contacts'' screen -- which is the first screen to appear after opening the ``Phone'' application.

Table~\ref{table:dial} shows that the total time it takes to call a person through dialing is estimated to be 68.6~seconds; while Table~\ref{table:favorite} shows that the total time it takes to call a favorite contact is estimated to be 15.5~seconds.
